# CS193P
Coursework from Stanford's CS193P 2013-14 Fall iPhone App Dev course. Lectures and assignments available on iTunes-U. This was the last course in Objective-C. Newer versions of the course are in Swift.

Notes: 
- all assignments are written in Objective-C
- all assignments are modified to use programatic layout rather than the suggested storyboards
