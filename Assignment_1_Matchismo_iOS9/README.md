Assignment 1 - Matchismo

Objective

This assignment starts off by asking you to recreate the demonstration given in the second lecture. Not to worry, the posted slides for that lecture contain a detailed walk- through. It is important, however, that you understand what you are doing with each step of that walk-through because the rest of the assignment requires you to add a simple enhancement and your assignment for next week will extend Matchismo even further.![My image](https://github.com/hannahmbanana/CS193P/blob/branch_firstProject/Assignment_1_Matchismo_iOS9/Course%20Documentation/Developing%20iOS%207%20Apps_%20Assignment%201.pdf)
